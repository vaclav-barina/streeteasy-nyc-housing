Analysis of Streeteasy NYC housing data

In this project, I downloaded Streeteasy's publicly available dataset to gain a better understanding of NYC Housing Trends. While Streeteasy already provides built-in visualizations on the data landing page, I conducted my own analysis to explore Python's capabilities for creating dashboards and to examine the raw data myself. I performed data cleaning using Python and the Pandas library. Subsequently, I transformed the data into a web-based dashboard using the Plotly and Dash libraries in Python.
